		<h2> The Land to the North </h2>
		<h4> <i> Amy Pan </i> </h4>	
		<p>There was once a man who lived in a great city, a bustling center of commerce and festivities in the heart of the land. The man led a decent life there, and though he was not rich, he never had any lack. He was, however, not satisfied with his lot. So, one day, he took only the bare necessities amongst his belongings, leaving the rest behind, and set off on a journey to the north, to a land of many legends.</p>
		<p>After a few days' journey along the road, the traveler sat down to rest on a tree trunk by a farm. The farmer was away that day, and his donkey was resting nearby. The farmer's donkey saw the traveler sit down and, out of curiosity, approached him. "Excuse me, sir," said the donkey, "if you don't mind my asking, I have never seen you in these parts before. Where do you come from?"</p>
