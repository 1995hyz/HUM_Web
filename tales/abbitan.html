            Once upon a time in an undisclosed location reigned queen Arabella.  While most monarchs sit on a throne and preen, Arabella used her position to better society.  Since the day of Arabella’s ascent, the ills in the social fabric were analyzed and she sought to remedy them.  She corresponded frequently with the brightest professors in the most prestigious universities and perused journal papers, particularly in the area of psychology.
        </p>
        <p>
            One sunny summer day, the stock markets experienced wild volatility.  The algorithmic trading strategies that process world news events were usually responsible.  After a couple of minutes, the news broadcasters deduced that this swinging was prompted by a tweet penned by Queen Arabella, as she was known to do:
        </p>
        <p>
            <!-- Need More Careful Formatting-->
            Competition in six months. ALL CITIZENS can attempt as many times as desired.  Anyone who successfully completes the course will receive a grand prize.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from this tweet, no other information was released about the competition.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the next six months, her subjects prepared themselves.  Because both the details and the location were undisclosed, everyone was scrambling to bolster their best asset.  The brainiacs spent their days working through logic puzzles and online coding challenges.  Gym classes were consistently at capacity with all of the muscular and toned citizens.  There was no dearth of cable-knit sweaters in the land, as the knitting-needle-wielding grannies were refining their stitch work.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the morning of the competition, an amber alert-like screech was heard emanating from all of the devices in the land.  Along with this tremendous sound, a digital message was broadcasted to all phones and smartwatches containing a geolocation to the competition site.  Within a half hour of the message broadcast, masses streamed to the competition site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within the crowd converging on the tournament area was Casey, an all-around average kind of person.  Not particularly brilliant, charismatic, wealthy or strong, he never stood out and generally got lost among the crowd.  He was of average height, a bit on the scrawny side, with dull, mousy brown hair.  During Casey’s school years, he never caused a fuss but also never distinguished himself.  If one were to inquire about Casey in the teacher’s room, no one would have much of anything to say about him, good nor bad.  Currently, he worked a decent job, nothing particularly prestigious or high-paying.  Despite all the mediocrity, Casey did have one secret advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Casey arrived at the competition, he saw only an array of virtual reality headsets with red swivel chairs beside them.  Humanoid guards led each participant to a chair and demonstrated how to wear the headset properly.  The headset transported the wearer to the tournament arena.  Casey put on the headset, feeling the weight of the bulky rectangular device weighing down on his face.
        </p>
        <p>
            As Casey was being transported to the arena, his visual field was overwhelmed by black and white static.  In his ear, he heard a soothing voice explain the rules of the game.  The tournament required each participant to successfully navigate a maze.  The end point of the maze was located in the center of the arena, and the participant was assured that he or she would be able to identify this landmark from all angles of the arena.  Any means of traversal were acceptable.  If the game became too difficult, a participant could just approach the humanoids stationed periodically throughout the maze for assistance in navigating back to reality, or the participant could simply remove the headset.  In addition, the participant could be transported back to the beginning of the maze by clapping his or her hands three times.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once Casey was deposited in the arena, he saw tall, green corn stalks in every direction.  The corn stalks formed the convoluted maze.  At the center of the arena was a narrow, cylindrical white watchtower the height of a skyscraper that glinted like the moon.  Casey craned his neck to examine the structure’s top floor.  It seemed to be a room with floor to ceiling windows in place of walls.  The room afforded a perfect panoramic view of the challenge arena.  Standing regally in the room was Queen Arabella alone, overseeing the proceedings.  Those who bothered to look up and squint through the windows, like Casey, noticed that Queen Arabella had donned a starched white doctor’s coat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many people around Casey were attempting the games.  Person after person failed.  Unbeknownst to the subjects, as the development of this technology was concealed from the public, the arena had a unique feature.  The sides of the virtual reality headsets contained special, classified sensors that could identify the crutch that the person leaned on when faced with adversity.  The virtually-constructed, personal rink then hindered the contestant’s support mechanism, rendering it ineffective.  All this time, Queen Arabella was taking notes feverishly, capturing tremendous amounts of data and running them through algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Queen Arabella noticed that many youngsters were being eliminated quite quickly.  The rink detected their overwhelming reliance on social media and cut off all cell phone service and wireless network signals.  It also emitted a magnetic field that mangled the connection between the internal power sources and their phones, watches and glasses.  The youngsters could not figure out how to possibly navigate through the maze without their trusty map applications.  Even the ones with a sense of direction gave up quickly: without the ability to document the experience through social media posts and stories, it was not worth it to them to participate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, Queen Arabella fixed her attention on the wealthy real estate moguls and bankers.  They did not need a prize, but thought that winning would give them much-coveted proximity to the Queen whom they sought desperately to influence to further their financial advantage.  They immediately approached the artificially intelligent guards in the rink and tried to bribe them with a super-battery in exchange for the secret of the maze.  The latest version of humanoids still required nightly charging to function optimally, in a manner similar to the cars of old (for those readers that remember hearing about cars from their grandparents).  The super-battery offered by the wealthy moguls would only need charging once per month.  Regulations banned such batteries, in fear of empowering the humanoids and fueling an AI rebellion, but the guards had deep desires for these transformative devices.  As the humanoids reached out to accept the bribe, it disintegrated into fine, green matcha powder.  The participants started to shout and  wave their hands in the air animatedly, screaming for their personal assistants and demanding to speak to a manager.  The AI guards just stared at them blankly. With no one catering to their debilitating frustration, the moguls and tycoons proceeded to file out of the ring.  Spending the time to navigate the maze was not worth it when they could be closing multi-billion dollar deals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The healthy enthusiasts in the rink caught wind of the battery-turned-matcha powder that was now available.  They decided to make a kale shake with it.  They knew that matcha powder promised to turbocharge the muscles, and considering that this matcha powder was derived from energy-providing batteries, they hoped it would be enough to allow them to leap over the tall corn stalks to the center tower.  Fortified by their matcha-kale concoctions, they attempted the leap.  Suddenly, the rink induced an overwhelmingly incapacitating wave of muscle charley-horse.  The health nuts started vomiting.  Apparently, there is bad synergy between matcha-batteries and kale.  Too ill to continue, this group also withdrew.
        </p>
        <p>
            Casey watched this sort of scenario play itself out over and over in one form or another.  However, he decided to begin to navigate through the maze anyways.  As he was traversing the path, he stumbled on a stone and landed splat on the ground.  After a beat, Casey pulled himself up, dusted off his knees, removed the gravel from his forearms and continued trekking.  After five hours of wandering through the maze, Casey was losing steam.  He was starting to smell like a mix of sweat and corn husks.  All of the stalks were blurring together before his eyes.  However, Casey decided to push forward.  After many hours, he was exhausted and found himself back at the entrance to the maze.  He looked around and noticed the rink was almost devoid of participants.  He realized that most had already given up, but he had never let that stop him before.  Casey was used to not being noticed, which gave him the freedom to explore situations without fear of failure and embarrassment.  He headed right back into the maze.  After attempting exactly four thousand, six hundred and nineteen times, he finally reached the tower and prepared to enter the open doorway and ascend to the top. Just as he was about to, Casey heard the sound of gears and levers and cranks, and paused in his tracks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Queen Arabella descended from the tower and granted Casey the prize.  Casey lived happily ever after.  And Queen Arabella published a revolutionary study on the lost art of perseverance:
