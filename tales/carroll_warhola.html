        <h2 style="text-align:center;"> As Above So Below </h2>
        <h4 style="text-align:center;"> <i> Oonagh Carroll Warhola </i> </h4>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 12px;">
            There was once a village up in the mountains. Fig trees everywhere! It was <br> 
inhabited by a clowder of cat people. Mountain cats of varying shapes, sizes, personalities, livelihoods, and relationships. It was <br> an odd town. For in <br>
the center was an amusement park. Villagers would go <br>
to the park solo or with familiars. This town was also victim to the strangest weather, <br> 
but only on certain days. On Fridays it would rain fish scales, so everyone would <br>
stay inside to avoid getting cut by the falling shards. But the following day would <br>
provide the loveliest of fogs, a sweet smelling fresh delicious mist. Just as beautiful and mysterious as the cats themselves. <br>
Beau was not like the others. He was afraid of heights, always <br>
yearning to be lower. However he had certain abilities that the others did not <br>
Possess, and he employed them in the town's bakeshop, which was a cover for a secret <br>
alchemy laboratory where he apprenticed. Artifacts of the outside world, <br>
samples of all sorts of elements, and astrological cycles were stored here. The <br>
bakeshop owner Eugenia was a strange woman and had many routines regarding the <br>
goods. They specialized in a unique bread that was outrageously popular, for the <br>
simple fact that it was considered a communication medium, and was the town's only export. The bread <br>
allowed certain villagers  to send out messages to whatever lay beyond the town's boundaries. For, it was common knowledge <br> that many denizens had been adopted long ago from other lands. Therefore the town consisted of other creatures, but the <br> majority being cats. Those who felt it in their bones that they did not belong would whisper into a <br>
Freshly baked bread and pray that it would be on the road to their true home, revealing <br>
the message to the mind of whomever consumed it. <br>
Beau knew that the day would come when he'd venture to the bottom of the <br>
mountains.  Some gravitational pull always had him facing that <br>
way. Beau had two younger sisters, an older brother who never spoke, a father who spent most the day picking fruit from the <br> orchards and partying at the amusement park, and a mother who kept everything together. At night his family was accustomed <br> to locking his door because he was a <br>
nightly sleepwalker. He had ended up in all sorts of places--the bakery cellar, <br>
stuck up in a fig tree, or at the town's edge in a ditch. And in the morning a little <br>
ditty would always linger in his mind. He was very accustomed to it and it would <br>
evaporate as the day wore on. As he grew  older, his sleep-walking only grew more persistent. One night when it was his <br> mother's turn to check in on him and <br>
lock his door, yet she forgot. So naturally he managed to escape the house. He <br>
walked far far away. Through the center, over the bridges, across the fern forest. <br>
Unscathed, he came to consciousness. He sat up, assessing. Running his claws through his fur, and breathing in the new air. <br>
He found himself  in a vast field of tall grass. It was not windy as  up in <br>
the mountains. The skies were clear. And still. Everything was still. <br>
The melody in his head was louder than usual. <br>  
 After what seemed an hour of wandering <br>
around, it became even louder. In fact, it sounded like it was coming from outside him <br>
Self. He followed, pulled by the sound and fell upon a shadowy figure. <br>
"What was that tune you were <br>
whistling?!" asked Beau excitedly. Startled, it turned around in astonishment. "It's a melody I've been hearing my whole life," <br> replied  the <br>
creature whose fur was a metallic bronze with rainbow sheen, like that of a pigeon's neck. Her face was so magical that he first <br> hadn't realized she was composed of contrasts. Like a griffin. He explained that he had also always heard that singular tune, <br> waking with it every morning. “My name is Shanel.” He was in a daze watching her wings ruffle as she spoke, and her mighty <br> paws gripped the earth as she paced. Shanel came from a <br>
town occupying the sky space. There, they lived up in mighty trees, their heads were <br>
always in the clouds, and they never walked the earth. Beau and Shanel  decided to continue together, to keep each other <br> company. They had been walking for <br>
a while, passing all sorts of strange things. Loaves of bread ripped apart now <br>
littered  the path.  Half eaten loaves could be seen  sitting on rocks. The two kept walking <br>
and encountered a clearing with the most gorgeous garden ever. Plants growing <br>
jewels and sparkling crystals, trees with branches bowing down with outstretched <br>
limbs offering a seat. There were fruits everywhere, the most delicious. The <br>
garden emanated the purr of a familiar tune. The ground crunched beneath their <br>
feet as they walked atop shimmering fish scales, forming dunes here and <br>
there. Two months later Beau found himself awake in a dream. He was talking to a bowl of batter that told him they must leave <br> for time was not what it seemed here. And it was a very familiar bowl, the kind they used in the bakeshop he worked back home. <br> Realizing he was at work back in mountain town, it felt devastatingly like a regular day. But upon closer inspection, it was <br> Eugenia's bowl, her special bowl which only she could use. That morning Beau <br>
relayed the message to Shanel imploring her to leave while they still could. Because what felt like a minute actually meant ten <br> days. <br>
Finally, as they left, the foliage around them began to change. It was spring <br>
when they had arrived  but now the air was crisp and the leaves were dry. <br>
Bare trees now paved their way. <br>
Regaining a clear mind they walked a long time in silence. A sea breeze <br>
picked up and the salty scent of the sea emanated. Beau had <br>
never smelt the sea or even seen it. And neither had Shanel.. All of a sudden, a gust of wind so strong <br>
lifted them off the ground. Shanel's wings grasped onto Beau <br>
as they were being pushed out over the  sea, hovering above the deep waters. <br>
Shanel's wings were soon to give out as she was no match against the <br>
winds. They crashed. Under the waters though it was <br>
delightfully warm, they were both gasping for air and terrified of drowning. As they sunk deeper <br>
and deeper they realized that they were breathing. As they chilled beneath <br>
the waters, looking up at the ocean ceiling growing farther and farther away, they <br>
descended gracefully into a giant coral reef. Neither had ever seen such <br>
colors. As they watched they noticed that little caves and openings occupied <br>
every nook and cranny of the reef. <br>
