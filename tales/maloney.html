        <h2 style="text-align:center;"> The Vision of the Twelve Jewels </h2>
        <h4 style="text-align:center;"> <i> Zekiel Maloney </i> </h4>
        <p class="drop-cap">
            On that day, I saw him descend from his realm, the Higher Realm, on an immense mountain in the Northern Sea. Following him was one who had the appearance of gold, one who had the appearance of fiery smoke, and one who had the appearance of a star. They were all radiant, but none more than he, so much so that I fell on my face. In his right hand was a scepter, and in the hands of the golden one was a chest that looked like glowing metal, and inside the chest were twelve coals and also twelve precious crowns, which were ground and filed from the finest jewels in the mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
            When they arrived at the bottom of the mountain they came south across the waters to the land, and when they arrived on the land, they found a place that was good, and there he laid the crowns on the earth. Once this was fulfilled, he took his scepter and made a hole in the earth that was within each crown, so that there were twelve holes. From the glowing chest he took each coal with his hands, and then lay each one in a hole, until all the holes were filled with a piece of coal and covered with earth.  He then released a drop of his golden blood in the middle of each crown, which kissed the earth and sank beneath the surface. Once he had fulfilled this act, the ground began to quake, and a figure erupted from beneath each crown and raised it up, so that the crowns sat perfectly on each figure's head. Smooth were their bodies, which were made of coal, and they stood as beautiful statues in a circle around him, whose radiant light caused them to shimmer exceedingly. After all of this had taken place, he, according to the order of their ascent from the ground, named them. When he named them, the insides of their crowns glowed, their eyes opened, and they breathed with life.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first child was Jasper, a boy, the second Sapphire, a girl, the third Agate, a boy, the fourth Emerald, a girl, the fifth Onyx, a boy, the sixth Ruby, a girl, the seventh Chrysolite, a boy, the eighth Beryl, a girl, the ninth Topaz, a boy, the tenth Turquoise, a girl, the eleventh Jacinth, a boy, and the twelfth Amethyst, a girl. They had consciousness, and he declared unto them:
        </p>
        <p>
            "You are my twelve children, whom I love. Though you are made of coal, you are jewels in my eyes, and the jewels and precious stones of this earth will be named after you. I have made you to be the twelve rulers, the twelve princes and princesses of this Lower Realm, to rule it with me. So I have placed crowns of jewel on your head, on which I have written myself and yourself. These you must not take off, lest you suffer." He continued to speak with an authority that could not be ignored, and I understood all of his words. "Though you are unique in manner and appearance, you must be united as one, for you have all come from the same mountain, my mountain. Stay together and remember me."
        </p>
        <p>
            Jasper then spoke, as he was the eldest jewel. "Father, what is your name, that we may know you by?"
        </p>
